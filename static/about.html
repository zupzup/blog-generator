        <p>My name is Mario, I'm a Software Developer and Trainer originally from Graz, but living in Vienna, Austria.</p>
        <p>After finishing my MSc in Software Engineering &amp; Economics at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/" target="_blank">TU Graz</a> I worked as a Full-Stack Web Developer for five years at <a href="https://netconomy.net/" target="_blank">Netconomy</a> doing mostly Java and JavaScript with a focus on Software Craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>In September 2016, I decided to quit my job to work as a freelancer and to dedicate some of my time to working in Open Source and sharing my knowledge.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, I worked at <a href="https://timeular.com/" target="_blank">Timeular</a> as a backend developer building, maintaining and operating microservices at scale using Java, Kotlin, Node, Go and Rust <3.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work at <a href="https://netconomy.net/" target="_blank">Netconomy</a> again, but this time in Vienna and as a Technical Trainer.</p>
        <p>Besides this blog, I also regularly write for the technical blog at <a href="https://logrocket.com/" target="_blank">LogRocket</a>, you can check it out <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>In the past, I organized the JavaScript User Group and taught software engineering courses for several years at the <a href="https://www.fh-joanneum.at/en/" target="_blank">FH Joanneum</a> in Graz. I frequently visit and speak at meetups as well.</p>
