        </p>
        <p>My name is Mario Zupan (<a href="mailto:mario@zupzup.org">mario@zupzup.org</a>), I'm a self-employed (<a href="#hireme">hire me</a>) Software Engineer and Trainer originally from Graz, but living in Vienna, Austria.</p>
        <p>After finishing my MSc in Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/" target="_blank">TU Graz</a> I worked as a Full-Stack Web Engineer for five years at <a href="https://netconomy.net/" target="_blank">Netconomy</a> building e-commerce platforms mostly using Java and JavaScript and a focus on Software Craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>After Netconomy, I worked as a freelancer for a while on various projects in different fields and since then, I continue to dedicate some of my time to open source and sharing my knowledge.</p>
        <p>Then, I worked at <a href="https://timeular.com/" target="_blank">Timeular</a> as a backend developer, designing, building, maintaining and operating microservices for a time-tracking solution at scale using Java, Kotlin, Node, Go and Rust.</p>
        <p>For the past couple of years, I worked at <a href="https://netconomy.net/" target="_blank">Netconomy</a> again, but this time as a Technical Trainer with a focus on application security, performance and software quality.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work as a freelance software engineer and trainer again, looking to help companies build high-quality software solutions.</p>
        <p>Besides this blog, I also regularly write for the technical blog at <a href="https://logrocket.com/" target="_blank">LogRocket</a>, which you can check out <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I also taught advanced software engineering courses for several years at the <a href="https://www.fh-joanneum.at/en/" target="_blank">University of Applied Sciences FH Joanneum</a> in Graz.</p>

        <h2>Hire me</h2>
        <div>
            <p>As a freelance Software Engineer and Trainer, I'm always looking for interesting contracts building software, consulting, or sharing my knowledge. I can work either remotely, or on-site in Vienna, Austria.</p>
            <p>I'm also more than happy to design and build custom software solutions together with you using a fixed-price model.</p>
            <p>I'm comfortable in many languages and technologies and while I have my own list of favorite tools (e.g. Rust <3), I believe in using the right tool for the job and in a pragmatic approach to technology choice.<br/> The most important thing for me is that I work on something worthwhile and useful, where I can apply my skills to have an impact on the quality of the outcome.</p>
            <p>I also taught courses, am comfortable speaking in public and have several years of experience when it comes to technical writing.</p>
            <p>I am reliable, transparent and easy to work with. I can deal with bumps in the road and feedback. I'm comfortable diving deep on a topic and sharing my findings. I have no problem taking over uncomfortable, or "boring" tasks, as long as they contribute to the end result.<br />Most of all, I try not to take myself too seriously and am always focused on great outcomes, rather than on religious debates on how to do things "the right way".</p>
